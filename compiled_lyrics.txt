that's a pretty big trunk
on my Lincoln town car ain't it
big enough to take these broken hearts
and put em in it..
now I'm driving round
on the boulevard trunk bleeding
and every time the cops pull me over
they don't ever see them
they never see them

and I've got this black suit on
roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
5 more miles till the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
imma try to swim from something
bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good
and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good
and swim good

got some pretty good beats
on this 808 CD, yeah
memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
i would've put tints on my windows
but what's the difference?
if i feel like a ghost no Swayze
ever since i lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
one more mile till the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
imma try to swim from something
bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good
and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good
and swim good

I'm going off
don't try stopping me
I'm going off
don't try saving me
no flares
no vest
no fear
waves are washing me out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
imma try to swim from something
bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good
and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good
and swim good

who's that talking in the library
who's that talking in my library
is that you
no i won't put you out
cuz what would this place be without my muse
nothing special
every book in here i wrote
some i'm not too proud of
some i wish i could burn
so many pages i wrote
wish i could revise them
but there's no erasing
and the best advice i got

was keep writing
and keep living
and keep loving
(oh lovin lovin lovin)
and when the ink dries
and the pages turn to dust
so will we
turn to dust
so will we
dust dust

who's that laughing in my library
who's that laughing in my library
is that you
no i wont put you out
cause what would this place be
without your smile
nothing special
i fell in love with you girl
you let yourself inside
with no respect for privacy
you said there's too much on my mind
then you ripped out a page
and set that shit on flame

i quit writing
i kept living
i kept loving
and when the ink dries
and them pages turn to dust
so will we
turn to dust
so will we
dust dust

i believe jehovah jireh
i believe there's heaven
i believe in war
i believe a woman's temple
gives her the right to choose
but baby don't abort
i believe that marriage isn't
between a man & woman
but between love and love
and i believe you when you say that
you've lost all faith
but you must believe in something
something something
you gotta believe in something
something something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
cause i just don't believe we're wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try
we all try
the girls try
the boys try
women try
men try
you and i
try try we all try

i don't believe in time travel
i don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
i don't believe our lives are simple
and i don't believe they're short
this is interlude
i don't believe my hands are cleanly
can't believe that you would
let me touch your heart
she didn't believe me when i said that
i lost my faith
said you must believe in something
something something
you gottta believe in something
something something

i still believe in man

i took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
sangria in a canteen
talking to myself
this tattoo on my left hand
is turning purple-ish blue
daydreams of the romance
daydreams of you
my pretty woman in a ballgown
i'm richard gere in a tux
getting married in a courthouse
writing vows in a rush
making out before the judge
with my teenage wife
got a wedding band done
that i just might die with

it's an american wedding
they don't mean too much
but we were so in love
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours
thats american law

m-r- s dot kennedy
she signed her name in pen
in a fancy fancy cursive
then turned her term papers in
a thesis on islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
hijabs and polygamist husbands
those poor unamerican girls
afterschool she ran to me
jumped in my 5.0
this is the home of the brave
land of the free
but your parents still didn't know
she said i've had a hell of a summer
so baby
don't take this hard
but maybe we should get an annulment
before this goes way to far

it's just an american wedding
they don't mean too much
they don't last enough
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours
american divorce

well you can have my mustang
that's all i've got in my name
but jesus christ don't break my heart
this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
but if you stay
girl if you stay
you'll probably leave later anyway
it's love made in the u.s.a

I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Been breathing so hard we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard then lay you right on the grass

Give it to you over again
Over again over again
Over again

See making love underneath the cherry leaves
Babygirl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said aww baby oh baby
Up against the cherry tree
Babygirl
I'll give it to you naturally

Naturally ohh

See feeling like adam when he first found out this existed
Me and my eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good
And it's all free
And it's all you
And it's only me
Playing in the dirt
Wrestling myself inside you

Give it to you over again
Over again over again
Over again

Making love underneath the cherry leaves
Babygirl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said aww baby oh baby
Up against the cherry tree
Babygirl
I'll give it to you naturally

and when those tears
have run out
you will be numb and blue

my grandaddy was a player
pretty boy in a pair of gators
see i met him later on
think it was 1991
the only dad i'd ever know
but pretty soon he'd be gone too
hide my face hide my face
can't let em see me crying
cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
and they weren't crying
my friend said it wasn't so bad
you can't miss what you ain't had
well i can
i'm sad and there will be tears
i've no doubt
there may be smiles
but a few
and when those tears
have run out
you will be numb
and blue

i can't be there
that's all you had to say to me was
you couldn't be there
why couldn't you say to me
you won't be there
you could've warned me
you wouldn't be here
right here
you wouldn't be here for me
~END~
when i was younger
i used to wonder like

if i was singing songs
just to sing the songs
or if was singing cause
that's what the bitches wanted
i couldn't play guitar like van halen
had no secret chords like saint david
but you still came around
ate your lunch wit me
used to park your car
to try to bus with me
but i would say "girl dont be dumb"
i'm riding shotgun

we could go to my house after school
after school after school
cause my dad don't clock off till late
off till late off till late
we could kick it in the living room
looking through my whole vinyl collection
and you could teach me how to slow dance or something
and i can give you chills harmonizing to
otis, isley, marvin

and everytime somebody asked me
if i sing songs to get at women

don't even listen to the songs i record
but she be banging that drake in my car

~END~
when we were kids
we handpainted strawberries on a swing
every moment was so precious then
i'm still kicking it
i'm daydreaming
on a strawberry swing
the entire earth is fighting
all the world is at its end
just in case
an atom bomb
comes falling on my lawn
i should say
and you should hear
i've loved
i've loved the good times here
i've loved our good times here

say hello
then say farewell
to the places you know
we are all mortals aren't we
any moment this could go
cry cry cry even though
that won't change a thing
but you should know
you should hear
that i have loved
i have loved the good times here
and i will miss
our good times here

spaceships are lifting off
of a dying world
and millions are left behind
while the sky burns
there wasn't room for you and i
only you
goodbye
goodbye
~END~
I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted
Did did not I can't feel nothin', superhuman
Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin'
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least she workin'
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of

Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

Sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like
Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of

[Brigde]
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine,
Numb the pain, Numb the pain, Numb the pain, Numb the pain, Numb the pain,
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine,
For the pain, for the pain, Novocaine, Novocaine

Novocaine for the pain

Pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity

I can't feel a thing,
I can't feel, can't feel a thing.
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her.
I can't feel, feel her,
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine.
I can't feel, feel her,
Novocaine for the pain, for the pain.
I can't, can't feel her, feel her, feel her.
Novocaine, Novocaine, caine, caine, caine.
~END~

Hand me a towel I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo
One time
We too loud in public then police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Red-bone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy city that night
No trees to blow through
But blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sunrise
Smoking good, rolling solo

Solo, solo
Solo, solo
S-solo, solo
S-solo, solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo

I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost, that clinic kill my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her Pickett fence
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
(By myself, by myself)
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
~END~

I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)

Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
Until the time...
(This love will keep people blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
'Till the time we die...
(This love will keep us still blinded by the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)

Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh

~END~
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your medal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
"Look guys, Jacksons!"
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking
Underneath moon light now
Pretty fucking
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning, haunting us with the beams
So it ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, hazy)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you call when I call again

On comes the evening
Both seeking ends
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)
~END~
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my momma like momma
I ain't making minimum wage momma
I'm on momma
I'm on
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800k momma
To stand on my feet momma
Play these songs, it's therapy momma, they paying me momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying y'all honest to God
I'm just a guy I'm not a God
Sometimes I feel like I'm a God but I'm not a God
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me momma
Let me run this bitch
I'm a run it into the ground momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you

I'm a stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese
Roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company
Please gimme immortality
I'm going rapidly
Fading drastically
Or pulled the zip down
Wet your lips first
Lick the tip now
Smoke some'n
Jamming to the rhythm it's a face to face
Keep me high castrati
Poonani fade the stress
Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da

I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door
I only got one four door
Remember when I had that Lexus no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so
I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Menage on my birthday
Tap out on the first stroke
Cause this ain't no work day
She don't give head anyway
Cause what niggas say
That's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets now
Shit starting to make my head hurt
Jay hit me on the email
Said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
Know and know
Know and know
Shout out to Hollygrove
I'm from that 7th though
Twins know and Lance
Clark know and Matt know
Shit went 180 on me
Please run that back though
Tucks til 24

You say some shit about me?
On God he grabbed me
Had this nigga like...
~END~
Now
To the edge I'll race you
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my four friends
We pour taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The hype right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you want to hold me now
You can't end me now
That might be what you need
~END~
I will be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hand through this, baby
In my mind, I didn't need
Warned your ex
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
How much longer baby?
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to the saved kids
Just like mine versions of these belong to you
After a while
They're keeping me close to you
~END~
Round the city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breath till I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust them anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (biiitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't trying to keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a seance
You are from a past life
Hope you're doing well bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body
New beginnings ahh
New beginnings wake up akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day bruh
Can't keep being laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive the
Every night shit
The every day shit

Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
Kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you ride come by
After my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, my every day shit
Every night shit

All my life, been running from you all my life
Been waiting on you all my life
All my life, you've been missing all my life

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God you should match it, it's that KO
No white lights til I fuck my 28th up
In 1998 my family had that Acura, oh
The Legend, kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the Reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoneys on occasion
After trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night

Drop the baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit, Kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, we don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that lovin' when you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Wanna see me bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
Everyday shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit
~END~
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float, white Ferrari
Had a good time
16: how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari

Close by me
You will find
You will find me
Is this the slow body
Left when I forgot to speak
So I text to speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Based takes it's toll on me
Eventually, eventually, yes
I only eventually, eventually, yes

I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
Good times
In this life, life
In this life, life

One too many years
So taste what I lived on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it's over in no time the best life

Ooh, oooh, oooh, ooh
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're smaller and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
I'm up and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a scar, at least that's what they call it
And we're free to fall
~END~
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of a loop is a loop)

This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think about dreaming a dream
Where I can not, where I can not
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon

(In the dark, in the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to... meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
You didn't need to... need to
I could dream all night
Dream all night
I could drive all night
Drive all night
Dreaming, dream on
~END~
Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make it shine last night
Could I make it shine, on it last night, last night
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it

It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
I, first time I done saw you
You text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
I, it's highlights when I was convinced
That it isn't much more it's so not you
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga

He told me

I used to fuck with all of 'em

Yeah I ain't got bitches no more

But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga, that shit Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to even feel about it
~END~
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
Must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you
Just like me

I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP
RIP Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me
But he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
That's good for us

We’ll let you guys prophesy
We’ll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We’ll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don’t know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he’ll hear what we do
It’s only awkward if you’re fucking him too
~END~
That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here

What a life, remember how it was, climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in shit
(We've come) Say what up to Magic, just shoot
Say what up to daddy
Say what up to life, I found it
And I know what you might want to know
Run from me and your team
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)
Give me somethin sweet
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin
This is life, life immortality

Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
(We're in the clouds)
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
(Life in the clouds)
Keep em high y'all

In the sky

Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a run away young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, getaway
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra

I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run run run run
You're beautiful to me
Run run run run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me

In my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end

We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep 'em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful

I'll take bullshit if that's all you got

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?
How you feel (how you feel)?
You know you were my first time (time).
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

Spendin' too much time alone...

Horses gallop to her throne

Still inside our parents' homes
(No I don't live in Denver)
No, I don't live in Denver

And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone

Tid bits of intuition that I been gettin' abandon admission (Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me, glistening,
Shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight (Sierra Leone)
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another cryin' babe into the world (girl now)
Our daughter's reachin' for the nipple cause it's time for her to eat
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time for go to sleep
I sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl if you knew what I know, knew what I know
Na, na na, na na, na...

And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me...
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, what is your woman
Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My God she's giving me pleasure

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
She's better with some fella with a regular job
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car drove far
Far's too close and I remember
My memories no sharp
Butter knife what a life anyway
I'm building y'all a clock stop
What am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man
We'd flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock knock on wood

You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock on wood
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood

Well frankly when that ocean so mahfuckin' good
Make her swab the mahfuckin' wood
Make her walk the mahfuckin' plank
Make her rob a mahfuckin' bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar

So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees

This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love, love...

I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

Run run run come back for my glory
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)

Bring her back to me
(Cleopatra, hey oh Patra ehh ehh Cleopatra)

Run run run the crown of our pharaoh
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)

The throne of our queen is empty
(Hey oh' Patra, Cleopatra)

And we'll run to the future
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world
A rocky, rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm
On the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids
Tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids
Voices fill up the halls

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

The jewel of Africa
(Jewel)
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious
How could you run off on me?
How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson
And his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra
Bad dreams Cleopatra

Remove her
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives, no more serpent in her room
No more, it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
That's right
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
~END~
Could this be earth, could this be light
Does this mean everythings going to be alright
One look out my window there's trees talking like people

I dreamt of storms, I dreamt of sound
I dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I slept in the darkness it was lonely and it was silent

What is this love, I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I awoke you there chasing planets on my forehead

But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a day dream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
But I'll fade to grey soon on the tv station
~END~
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (high!)
Go ahead, fly that thing!
High! High!
But fly alone

You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss around

I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known

I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby (Yo we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weight the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this

Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weight the work I got on your girl (Too weird to live, too weird to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?

She's at a stove (Who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be
Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
No nothin' wrong with a lie
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)
~END~
Look up, look up, look up
You'll see the last line in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they, come crashing down
It'll be, the worst surprise

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Till you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Feels like I'm on the 30th floor
Starring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You're marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they, come crashing down
It'll be, the worst surprise

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Till you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They're coming down, coming down
They're coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Till you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Look up, look up
And baby you'll see the light
You'll see him flying
Look up, look up
You'll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground

Wiseman closed his mouth
Madman closed his fist
Young man shows his age
Judge man named it sin
Bad man don't exist, no
No evil man exists
Good man don't exist, no
No righteous man exists
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see
Never witnessed his father weep
This old man thought it weak
But strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist, no
Just flesh and blood exists
But your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you

The beast will crawl this earth
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
'Till all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain
You saw it unfold
What you know
And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you

Primate sharpens tool
To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be drug through mud
You're my brother but your eyes are cold
You're my sister but your womb is bare

I bet our mother would be proud of you
I bet our mother would be proud of you

Bad man don't exist
No evil man exists
I know good man don't exist
No righteous man exists
Strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist
No just flesh and blood exists

With all my might I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker
Our life all this
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there we're making out listening to pruple rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

This is has been one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears
So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her

I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twen
Twice we could see it 'til the end
~END~
If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere baby
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby

Did you know ?

News said that the sky is fallin'
The globe is warmin'
My country's warin'
The leaders a liar
Time is runnin'
Lower and lower babe lower babe
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end
End baby, quickly

Told me I don't even know your name
I said well then we mine as well make ours the same
What you think baby. (No time)
Vegas might as well be light years away
So we better lay under the stars
Before they crashin' down

That's right baby kiss me like the world is wicked
Like the Earth is shakin'
You got it baby
That's right love me
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out on us

I know we just met but baby could you love me quickly, quickly
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end
Baby, quickly, yeahh
Barely know me baby
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly
Ohhh
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end baby
Quickly
Gotta love me baby, quick now
Gotta love me baby, quickly now
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end baby, quickly

Lou said the sky was fallin, yeah
Lou said. Ohh na naaa
~END~
Okay, thought about it for a minute
Can't let love go spinnin' down the drain now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen & pad; gotta work out

You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
It can't be hard

Gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no
Been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wrackin' my brain
No love still
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
No love still
No love

Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie

You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, She's my future, my right now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out boy
I know it's hard

Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
Can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
Never had a clue
~END~
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
Cause it's still so hard to live with it

I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could beat the sunrise
Ready to grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away

It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking down 42nd tryna clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I've been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could beat the sunrise
Ready to grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away

See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
Cause ain't no getting back the love that's gone
I won't be crying no more and how it unfolds
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away
~END~
Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful thighs

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting,
We'll still go at this time"

Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big Bang, Big Bang, look at what we made beautiful

You look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this Eclipse ooh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

"Twenty seconds and counting.
Fifteen seconds and counting.
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, ignition sequence starts,
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
All engines running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff!"
~END~
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on the ceiling to count
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby

You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story
Oh

I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on the ceiling to count
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby

You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story
Oh

You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, I'm thinking of you
Baby I, I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, I'm thinking of you
Baby I, I'm thinking of you

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream
Baby you're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
My bedtime story, bedtime story
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words in my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

I love you
I love you

~END~
Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain’t a better way to say it
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain’t here

So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn’t matter
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all

I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My so glow with the low cut
No jheri curl, jerry rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, don’t think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin me
Swearin’ he’s grown and he’s got that skill
But he ain’t swim with that blue whale
I ain’t swim with that hoe neither
Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water
Hope the monster don’t wag his tale
And send that big wave over while
I’m showin off my pirate girl
To the baddies walkin by me

Showin skin because its nothing
My little brother servin’ molly
Because that bill due Monday
And my passports buried
And my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water
But my shoes still muddy

And if I ever have a daughter
I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach
I guess I call her karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat
I’m kidding but I’m ballin’
Just playin’ but I’m serious
I’m wit it and I’m wildin

This life goes on man that’s one thing about it
This life goes on dawg that's one thing about it
I’m feelin’ what your sayin’, you’re trying to get around it
But life goes on pimpin, the wise don’t doubt it

Stuck in the sky, first time upside down, on the whole ride
And I wasn’t much into the type, that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that’s alright
Black women ain’t got no man
That’s what she said to me, yeah she did
But she can date outside your race, I mean
I ain’t supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case I mean
Somebody please switch my plates
Ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain’t ridin chrome
Back pack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let a relevant nigga do, what a relevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge, because his gavel fake and he regular still
How that gravel taste? how you paid your medical bills?
Sands white on my tan feet
Coliseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your mac sleep
Relaxing
I ain’t racing no fuckin’ rats
I'm relaxing
And if its wrong to yah

Well life goes on brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on my nigga one thing about it
I’m sayin’ what you’re seein’, we trying to talk around it
But life goes on pimpin, the wise done doubt it

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level I am the I am (whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride
Ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife"
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick
Clips on clips like Mikey
It's really all

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by they selves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards
Amazing the cash online unknown
Blazing the dash counting money at home
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards

I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie I'm sorry so sorry

I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her

No Bonnie

The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby
My Bonnie, My Bonnie

No Bonnie
No Bonnie, I'm sorry
So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie
~END~

She singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and MJG, yeah

But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

~END~
I’m out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, goldfinger wheels
Driver can’t steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like “Where’s there parking round here”
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

You’ve got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You’d be a gun but your a girl
Only if whipping could kill

Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You’re driving with no shoes – cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a sense just like the

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

I just finished practice
She’s on her way to get me, she’s in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes (I’m finna hop in the shower)
Girl I hope 20 don’t mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I’ve been thinking ’bout your skirt on my head rest

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing

I let you drive my Benz
Flossing all your friends round town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I always keep it clean
So why don’t you park in the front just to stunt
That’ll make all them bitches mad
Why don’t you lift up the roof just to stunt
It’ll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you
~END~
I just wanna make love
Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
Imma hit a few keys bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now (ow)
Fix you up another Mai Thai (Thai)
No sun on the horizon (on)
Let's make a song for the night time (time)

I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

Stroke of harmony kiss you on your neck
I'm changin up your voice sound (changin up your sound)
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
and make you climax now (ahh ahh)
Now we switching up the melody (ay!)
We take it down to a minor stage (stage)
We making noise like we can't believe (ay)
Let's put this moment on replay

Oooooh
Girl what'cha you wanna - dooo
Back it up, back it up, back it up up up
I think I got a cluuue
Girl whatcha you wanna doooooo
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
~END~
I told her that I missed her put her on a plane
Goyard luggage just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga I wouldn't be the same

She met me at the W grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it so glad she came
Told me she was in love she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane she didn't feel the same

I made a change for my baby a difference for love
And I ain't frontin' feel like you were the one
I got the ring girl if you want could have my name
Girl if you want

See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling the at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love

If you been searching too long
You knew that other lover wasn't feeling the at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love
A sucker for love a sucker for love

So now we're loving the winter flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me the crush has been insane

She's a 1 of 1 D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good she wish that it would stay

Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh
Love, we did for we did it for love love love

See baby looking so long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all

Been searching too long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all

Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh
Love, we did for we did it for love love love
