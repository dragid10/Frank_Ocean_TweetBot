My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level I am the I am (whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, No√©
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride
Ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique on the net
